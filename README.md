    This is my Smart Weather Monitoring System using IoT project. In this project, the following three parameters are monitored:<br>
    1. Temperature<br> 
    2. Humidity<br>
    3. AQI<br>

Below is the description of the code files:<br>
    DHTtester.ino: This file contains code for DHT11 integration with Arduino. <br>
    MQ135Tester.ino: This file contains code for MQ135 integration with Arduino.<br>
    WeatherTester.ino: This file contains code for complete weather monitoring system without using LCD display.<br>
    sketch_weather.ino: This file contains code for complete weather monitoring system using LCD display.<br>
