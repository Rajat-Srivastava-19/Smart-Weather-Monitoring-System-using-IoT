# Smart-Weather-Monitoring-System-using-IoT
This is my Smart Weather Monitoring System using IoT project. In this project, the following three parameters are monitored:
    1. Temperature 
    2. Humidity
    3. AQI

Below is the description of the code files:
    DHTtester.ino: This file contains code for DHT11 integration with Arduino. 
    MQ135Tester.ino: This file contains code for MQ135 integration with Arduino.
    WeatherTester.ino: This file contains code for complete weather monitoring system without using LCD display.
    sketch_weather.ino: This file contains code for complete weather monitoring system using LCD display.
